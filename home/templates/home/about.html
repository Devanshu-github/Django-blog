                The desire to Revolutionalize...
                Will now be supported, promoted and voiced by this forum which is to initiate, to speak, to discuss,
                to condemn, to criticise, to appreciate and to finally revamp the whole society starting from
                revamping thoughts and vision.

                Our society, from ancient times has fallen prey to narrow-mindedness and reluctance to positive
                reformation. Issues created and prevailing as a result of this reluctance is visible everyone but
                are censured publically by a very small fraction.
                Quaint Vision is a voice against them all, whether it be the creator or acceptor of societal and
                mental termites. And now, we've initiated to make you all a part of this historical journey towards
                eradiacting these termites and correcting the roots with not only the vision to change, but also the
                incentive to start a revolution through mental revamping.

            <p class="lead">Who doesn't wish to see this society and minds of people change for good? The drowning
                quality of thoughts and life is seen by everyone but people either fear to speak up or care it damn
                to give these issues their due consideration, time and effort unless something widely noticeable
                greets the mass.
                We here aim to inculcate in minds of people, the importance of discussing things that are hollowing
                the foundation of humanity, the importance of going deep into the things happening with our agers,
                and the things which has degraded humanity since ages, and the things which are lowering the quality of
                thoughts with descending physical time. WE ARE AIMING FOR A CULTURE WHICH CONSIDERS EVERYBOY'S
                OPINION EQUALLY, AND FOREMOST, STARTS TO THINK, SPEAK AND ACT.</p>
